Instructions:
Howdy y'all. Let's keep track of what ablation study we're conducting using this. I'll push this to main, and then for each
branch we make we can edit this file to describe it (also edit the branch name). This can also serve as a general notes file.
Additionally, put the success you've had in running your ablation at the top of this file (we need to figure out error functions
and a way to capture the resulting video), along with the running time. Remember, we're trying to chart what solutions we can
make to optimally reduce running time without degrading quality.

Here's the nomenclature I'm proposing. We want to initially try ablation studies of making the architecture deeper and shallower.
Additionally, experimenting with making it wider. Later we may try something with the positional encoding.

For changing the number of layers: ablation_#_of_layers
For changing the width of layers: ablation_#_of_paremeters_per_layer
For both: ablation_#_of_layers_#_of_parameters_per_layer

For changing the positional encoding: TBD
